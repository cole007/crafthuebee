## Craft Huebee Overview

Huebee is a simple color picker library replacing the default Craft color picker.

## Using Craft Huebee

When defining a Huebee field you can specify a default value. Otherwise the value will default to blank. 

## Craft Huebee Roadmap

Some things to do, and ideas for potential features:

* Fix issue with overlap from #container when picker is activated (CSS)
* Custom settings to specify which format (eg hrex, shorthex, hsl)
* Custom settings to specify custom colours as a predefined palette
* Release it
